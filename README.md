# fashion-recommender-system
## Goal
The ultimate goal is to design a fashion recommender system that can give me clothing recommendations based on weather and temperature along with other features.
Currently, I am building the base of this system; the database - how each item of clothing is stored and organized.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQL (mySQL)

## To-Do
- Class for each subtype -> Clothing Class to ADT?
- Make text-based UI to add clothes
  - Can sort/filter, retrieve, add, delete

## Virtual Closet
### 1. Create a class for clothing  [in progress]
- design class [complete]
- implement class [in progress]
- implement sub-classes [in progress]

### 2. Create a database to store clothing items [in progress]
- Learn SQL [complete]
- Design Database [complete]
- Implement Database [in progress]

## Recommender System
- likely similar to weighted graph
- need to figure out how to compute similarity score
- has to take in feedback

## UI/UX
- It would be convenient if I could turn it into an app but that may not be feasible
- Website first, then try to turn it into an app

## Future Features
- Recommendation based on weather/temperature (and other factors)
- Feedback System
- Extracction of clothing information from a picture (computer vision)
