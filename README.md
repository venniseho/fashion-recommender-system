# fashion-recommender-system
The ultimate goal is to design a fashion recommender system that can give me clothing recommendations based on weather and temperature along with other AI features (i.e. computer vision).
Currently, I am building the base of this system; the database - how each item of clothing is stored and organized.

## Tech Stack: 
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQL (mySQL)
