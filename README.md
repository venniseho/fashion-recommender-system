# fashion-recommender-system
## Goal
The ultimate goal is to design a fashion recommender system that can give me clothing recommendations based on weather and temperature along with other features.
Currently, I am building the base of this system; the database - how each item of clothing is stored and organized.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python
- Database: SQL (mySQL)

## Recommender System

## UI/UX
- It would be convenient if I could turn it into an app but that may not be feasible
- Website first, then try to turn it into an app

## Future Features
- Recommendation based on weather/temperature (and other factors)
- Feedback System
- Extracction of clothing information from a picture (computer vision)
